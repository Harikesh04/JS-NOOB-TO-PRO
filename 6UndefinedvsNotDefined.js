// Undefined: a variable is 'declared', it has its own placeholder but not having the value
//  of itself 'defined' hence 'undefined' and until the variable has assigned a value, the 
//  'undefined' fills that particular placeholder
// and 'undefined' is itself a datatype


// Not Defined: This case comes in error where js engine neither find that particular 
//variable nor its placeholder
//  and cannot find the variable in 1st phase of context (Memory allocation context)

// and yes "flexibly typed language" sound pretty good instead of "weakly typed language"
