// As we have already discussed in the into file  that everything happens in javascript in the **execution environment i.e GLOBAL EXECUTION CONTEXT. So the entire execution happens in two phases as follows

// 1. Memory allocation phase- all the **variables  and **functions get their memory allocated
//  in the memory with {undefined**} and the entire code  respectively. 

// 2. Code execution phase - in this phase  {**thread execution happens} and all the variables get  their actual values which were assigned to them and as function is invoked, a new execution environment gets created in the code part, and again there are two phases, memory allocation and code execution
  
//   allocation phase and code execution phase. And the cycle repeats.
