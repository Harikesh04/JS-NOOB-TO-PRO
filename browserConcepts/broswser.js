// Node.js

// Node.js is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 engine, designed to run JavaScript code server-side. It allows developers to build scalable network applications using asynchronous, event-driven programming. Node.js is essential for tasks like serving dynamic content, handling APIs, and using build tools (like Webpack, Babel) in frontend development. Its non-blocking I/O model makes it ideal for building high-performance, real-time apps.

// we can run normal html , js , css  by go live . but it will won't work for complex react apps

//Development Workflow Summary:

// Start Development Server (e.g., npm start): Starts Webpack/Vite-based dev server.
// Transpile JSX and ES6+ code: Babel/esbuild converts JSX and modern JavaScript into browser-compatible code.
// Bundle Files: Webpack/Vite bundles your modules (JavaScript, CSS, assets) into optimized files for the browser.
// Serve to Browser: The server delivers the bundled files to the browser.
// Live Reload or HMR: When you make changes, only the modified parts are recompiled and sent to the browser for instant updates.


// Does it Use Babel in Development?

// bowser cann't understand jsx so it's required for converstion in js
