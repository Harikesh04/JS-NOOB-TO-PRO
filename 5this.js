// 1. Shortest Program in JS: Empty file. Still, browsers make GEC and global
// space along with Window object.
// 2. Global Space: Anything that is not in a function, is in the global space.
// 3. Variables present in a global space can be accessed by a "window" object.
// (like window.a)
// 4. In global space, (this === window) object.

// every thing is defined in a global space except the data inside the func  are assign 
// in local space
